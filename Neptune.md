## Why Neptune should be loved more. 

No one ever remembers about Neptune. 

*Poor Neptune*. 

It's so far away, but everyone *always* remembers about Uranus. Why is that? 

I propose we start a new group that aims to provide support for Neptune! 

**Long live Neptune!**

Let us all rejoice that we have Neptune.
